# DotFiles (Fish)

A set of environment variables, functions and aliases for the Fish shell. Nothing here will gonna work for bash or zsh :D

## Some Assumptions
- All the programming stuff goes on the `~/dev` folder that contains two folders: **projects** and **dotfiles**.

## Instalation

- Clone this: `git clone git@github.com:juliogarciag/dotfiles-fish.git ~/dev/dotfiles/fish`.
- Go to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
- Add the next line to that file: `source ~/dev/dotfiles/fish/profile.fish`.
- Save it.
